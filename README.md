# Module Descriptions
## 1. Audio Module
	•	Purpose:
Captures and processes audio input.
	•	Components:
	•	processor.py: Contains functions and algorithms for processing raw audio data (e.g., noise reduction, normalization).
	•	recorder.py: Manages the audio recording process, interfacing with hardware or software APIs to capture sound.

## Speech Module
	•	Purpose:
Converts spoken language into text.
	•	Component:
	•	recognizer.py: Implements speech-to-text functionality using AI models to accurately transcribe audio input into text.

##  Text Module
Purpose:
Analyzes and processes the transcribed text.
	•	Component:
	•	analyzer.py: Performs natural language processing tasks such as text categorization, extraction of relevant information (e.g., addresses, keywords), and overall text analysis.

 ## Location Module
 Purpose:
Provides geocoding and location-based services.
	•	Components:
	•	geocoder.py: Translates text-based addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
	•	suggestions.py: Offers AI-driven location suggestions, enhancing user experience with context-aware recommendations.

## Utils Module
	•	Purpose:
Contains utility functions and common services used across the project.
	•	Component:
	•	logger.py: Implements logging mechanisms to record application events, errors, and performance metrics for easier debugging and monitoring.

# Main Application
	•	File: main.py
	•	Purpose:
Acts as the central entry point of the application. It orchestrates the workflow by:
	•	Initiating audio recording and processing.
	•	Converting speech to text using the speech module.
	•	Analyzing the resulting text for relevant information.
	•	Using the location module to geocode addresses and generate suggestions.
	•	Logging and handling errors throughout the process.

The project’s modular design ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to maintain, scale, and enhance over time. Each module specializes in a specific functionality, enabling developers to update or upgrade individual components—such as integrating advanced AI models or additional geocoding features—without affecting the entire system.
